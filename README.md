# Sentiment Analysis using IndoNLU Dataset

This repository contains my personal project on Sentiment Analysis using the IndoNLU dataset. The project focuses on applying machine learning algorithms, specifically the pretrained IndoBERT model from IndoNLU using PyTorch and an SVM classifier.

***Note: This repository is actively maintained and will be updated in the future with additional models and further development of existing models.***
## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the IndoNLU dataset, which consists of text samples classified into three sentiment classes: positive, neutral, and negative. It is a comprehensive and diverse dataset that allows for training and evaluating sentiment analysis models for the Indonesian language.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms were utilized in this project:

1. IndoBERT: IndoBERT is a pretrained language model specifically designed for the Indonesian language. It is based on the BERT architecture and has been fine-tuned on various downstream tasks, including sentiment analysis. The IndoBERT model is implemented using PyTorch.

2. SVM Classifier: In addition to the IndoBERT model, an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier was also employed. SVM is a popular machine learning algorithm that can effectively handle classification tasks. It is a powerful tool for sentiment analysis and can provide reliable results.

## Results

The results of the sentiment analysis model can be evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into the performance and effectiveness of the model in classifying sentiments accurately. From the colab file, we can see that the IndoBERT model has better performance comparing to SVM classifier model. However, the SVM model may be further improved in the future.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge the IndoNLU team for providing the pretrained IndoBERT model and the IndoNLU dataset. Their contributions have been instrumental in the development of this project.
